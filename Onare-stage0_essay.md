**The Role of Supervised Learning in Cancer Therapeutics**

Cancer has posed to be an increasing global challenge, in 2022, there were an estimated 20 million new cases and 9.7 million deaths. The estimated number of people who were alive within 5 years following a cancer diagnosis was 53.5 million [1]. The early detection of cancer may lead to decreased morbidity with improved survival, and in some situations, treatment may require only surgery if identified early enough [2]. This can be achieved through Supervised learning, a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data. This has become increasingly relevant in the field of cancer analysis, offering new ways to tackle cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

**Supervised Learning and Its Application in Cancer**

Supervised learning techniques are employed to create models that predict future outcomes for specific data categories [3]. The applications of supervised learning as explained as follows:

**Cancer Diagnosis and prediction**

Machine learning detects cancer biomarkers via gene expression profiles [11]. With advances in computer vision, focus has shifted to diagnosis from raw images, particularly in breast cancer. Machine learning enables early cancer detection by identifying hidden patterns in data [3]. Supervised learning algorithms improve classification accuracy by discovering subtle associations between molecular markers and cancer types [4].

**Treatment Planning for cancer**

Predictive models from supervised learning help oncologists personalize treatment plans by predicting responses to therapies [6]. Genomic data aids in predicting clinical responses in pan-cancer analyses [8] and targeted interactions like leucovorin and fluorouracil in colorectal cancer. Machine learning predicts treatment responses for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC [7] and combines clinical and imaging features for breast cancer [9].

**Drug discovery**

For the development of anti-cancer drugs, supervised learning assists in identifying potential drug targets by analyzing the relationships between chemical compounds and their biological effects. This also provide insights into designing novel drugs that efficiently suppress the disease. Machine learning approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data [11].

**Challenges Associated with Cancer Research Supervised Learning**

Machine learning shows great promise in cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy, but several data-related challenges hinder its use. Issues include excessive noise, lack of labeled data, data heterogeneity, imbalance, multisource domains, and data isolation [10]. Machine learning models are often seen as "black boxes," making it hard to understand their predictions. Interpretability is crucial for understanding these models' conclusions and the biological mechanisms of cancer. Additionally, these models are prone to overfitting, performing well on training data but struggling with new data, especially when data is limited or biased [5].

**Conclusion**

Cancer remains a significant global challenge, with millions of new cases and deaths each year. Early detection and personalized treatment are important for improving survival rates, supervise learning offers great potential in this regard. By training models on labeled data, supervised learning can enhance cancer diagnosis, informed treatment plan, and drug discovery. However, challenges such as the quality of data, model interpretability, and overfitting persist, underscoring the need for continued research and refinement in applying machine learning to cancer analysis. Despite these obstacles, the potential benefits of supervised learning in advancing cancer care are substantial.
