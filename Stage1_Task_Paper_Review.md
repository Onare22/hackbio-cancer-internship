**Introduction**

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Analyses of high-dimensional data and various data types are required for cancer research. Machine learning (ML) models identify the patterns in data and help in predictions through algorithms. It has emerged as a powerful tool for early detection, prognosis prediction, and evaluation of drug responses in lung cancer.

**Utilization of ML in Early Detection and Auxiliary Diagnosis**

Early detection of lung cancer is key to reducing mortality. Traditional CAD systems for CT scans failed to identify malignant nodules due to subjective features. Deep learning-based CAD systems improved this by using CNNs which automatically extract the features of cancer nodules and modelling them. Histological imaging, with CNNs, classifies cancer types and predicts mutations. GAN models overcome the overfitting of limited labeled data by generating synthetic datasets to improve classification accuracy.

Omics sequencing and ML further aid cancer classification. Genetic variations and blood-based biopsies help identify tumour markers. Copy number variations from DNA methylation profiles and RNA sequences support classification. Techniques like LASSO are used for feature selection to reduce overfitting and identify key genes linked to lung cancer.

**Prediction of prognosis, therapy response and survival through ML**

Evaluation metrics like RECIST, Tumour Proportional Scoring, and IC50 assess cancer therapy responses. ML models identify tumour growth patterns and recurrence, evaluating therapy response. ML-based models also have the potential to accurately predict the prognosis and survival of patients through various omics datasets.

**Immunotherapy response prediction using ML**

Immunotherapy's effectiveness varies due to the unique tumour microenvironment. ML models predict patient responses by analyzing gene expression profiles, CT scans, and radiomic biomarkers. Logistic regression and random forest models are trained to evaluate immunotherapy outcomes, while CNN models use tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes as metrics for response prediction.

ML models identify tumour-specific peptides from somatic mutations that trigger an anti-tumour response. These models assess the affinity between mutated peptides HLA alleles, helping to determine potential neoantigens.

**Challenges and Future Perspectives**

ML models are database effective as their performance may vary from one dataset to another. The absence of generalizability and robustness is also a limitation that is overcome by feature selection Using a pre-trained model while training the original datasets has improved the efficiency and robustness of ML models.
